							<h4>Sysadmin</h4>
							<img src="/media/pacman.gif" class="img-fluid img-rounded img-thumbnail" alt="A package manager updating packages">
							<p>I always love to explore new things about Arch Linux, the Linux community and system management. For example, I'm interested in installing Arch Linux, trying out LUKS encryption or install different Linux VMs to learn something new from each Linux distro. I don't fear using hard-to-use distros like Gentoo; but daily driving it is just not ideal.</p>
							<p>If someone asks me what kind of sysadmin I am, I'd say I'm a power user. I love taking control over my own PC, whether it's managing services, running scripts, installing new packages, or even delete my entire system (<code>sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /</code>, a dangerous command). It might sound scary, but to me, it is the freedom to do ANYTHING when you have all the administrative rights.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="col-md-4">
							<h4>Programmer</h4>
							<img src="/media/python.gif" class="img-fluid img-rounded img-thumbnail" alt="Python programming">
							<p>So far, I've learned a lot of programming languages like Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, C, Java, and a bit of C++ or Bash scripting. Through the way, I continue to learn new interesting things; for example, when I finished the basics of Java and start to learn C++, I notice interesting similarities like the OOP philosophy and differences such as the lack of true pointers in Java (for safety reasons).</p>
							<p>Every programming language I learn builds skill and confidence. Over the years, with basic C knowledge, I managed to create some very simple programs, but they got rejected on the Arch User Repository (AUR). That's fine. I'm not someone with advanced C knowledge. But if it was someone who wanted simple HTML webpages, I'd shine.</p>

							<h4>Philosopher</h4>
							<img src="/img/fsf.png" class="img-fluid img-rounded img-thumbnail" alt="FSF homepage">
							<p>I support the movement of Free Software (free in terms of freedom, not in terms of price) and the Four freedoms: to be able to run code, to be able to modify the source code, to be able to distribute it and to be able to distribute your own modified versions. Basically, this gives fairness to both users and whatever company that sold the product to you. It doesn't have to be $0; it just has to be freely distributable and the source code has to be open to the public.</p>
							<p>For those who do not know, free/open-source software gives more advantages than most people think. Any team of developers can inspect a free application for malicious functionalities, or lure out anti-user features and redistribute it for you. People can also share and improve code. But the originator goes to the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> led by Richard Matthew Stallman. For even more info, see the book: "Free software, Free society" by Richard Stallman.</p>

				<h3>How I became a...</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h4>Sysadmin</h4>
						<p>I became a sysadmin because I heard a lot about Linux and then I decided to research about it. When I asked ChatGPT I was able to learn about it. Initially, I thought Linux only had two distributions: Canonical Ubuntu and Arch Linux. It was because ChatGPT only hinted at them. After a while, I finally figured out Linux had thousands of distros, all over the internet, community-driven and varying. It started to sound more and more interesting. I tried a hard-to-use distro as my first distro, Arch Linux. I spent one week figuring out how to install it properly, and I did. It was satisfying. From then I start to learn more about Linux operating systems.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h4>Programmer</h4>
						<p>I started programming when I was really young. I was wondering how apps and games were created, so I decided to start learning programming. I started learning Python at first, but somehow because of the teaching style or something, it didn't appeal to me. So I got a book about Python and though I don't understand everything in the book, I still found it interesting. Then I learned a lot of programming and IT at FUNiX, an education system of FPT. That was how I grew my dreams big and tall.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h4>Philosopher</h4>
						<p>This happened when I was hoping to find more information about Linux. I got an idea in mind that I would research films or movies about Linux, and upon searching up I got two documentaries: Revolution OS and The Code. I watched Revolution OS on YouTube and I finally got to know about Richard Matthew Stallman - the man behind GNU/Linux, the Free Software Foundation, and a lot of GNU projects. The more I explore about him, the more I get interested in free (libre) software and software ethics. As a brief summary, Richard Stallman believes software should give users freedom and the source code should be open (access to source code can help you do anything).</p>

						<h4>‚ùå wordrnd - a failed AUR project</h4>
						<img src="/img/wordrnd.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A CLI word randomizer">
						<p>This is a simple word randomizer that generates a lot of words related to programming and/or sysadmins, and it acted as a simple exercise to practice my C skills. I also decided this would be my first AUR project: I'd push my project to a place where more people would be able to see my project, especially Arch users. However, it got deleted by Trusted Users, but life is too beautiful to be sad. It's a package meant to be casual and useless.</p>
						<h4>Source</h4>
						<a href="https://github.com/gducpm/wordrnd">GitHub</a><br>
						<span>Deleted from AUR</span><br>

							<div class="progress-bar bg-danger progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" style="width: 80%"></div>
						</div>
						<p>Even if it was deleted, it was my first ever package on the AUR.</p>

						<h4>‚úÖ GDucpm's Games (Legacy) - A standalone niche site</h4>
						<img src="/img/gducpmgames.png" class="img-fluid" alt="One of my games on GDucpm Games">
						<p>GDucpm Games is a niche site past me made to practice my HTML skills (that looks quite similar to what you're seeing but with ads). It is... a suite of 3 games and 3 experiments made using TurboWarp, Scratch's mod which allows for faster execution and HTML packaging support. I actually used AI to generate some of the site's content, but that's why my writing skill massively improved after (I wasn't good at writing in English before).</p>
						<h4>Site</h4>

						</div>
						<p>I'd say, when I was younger and developed this website, I put ads into this site and then I had to wait for Google AdSense to approve my site. I had to wait 1-2 months, and the request initially failed. Then I would open AdSense everyday to see how I've gained. It's not much, but it's definitely money.</p>

						<h4>‚úÖ ttybatd - For people who likes using TTYs on laptops</h4>
						<img src="/img/ttybatd.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Github page of ttybatd">
						<p>I loved using the TTY; but one thing that stopped me is that because it didn't have low battery warnings. ttybatd is a simple bash-based daemon (background service) that warns you when your battery is really low. It only works on the <code>systemd</code> init system. So you can finally turn on h4xx0rm0d3 without worrying about power supply.</p>

						<p>This is a project that is actually useful; especially to the Arch Linux community. I feel I have done a real contribution.</p>

						<h4>‚ùå [CANCELED] GDucpm Services</h4>
						<img src="/img/gducpmservices.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GDucpm Services website">
						<p>It's... a big project I decided to do when I was younger. I tried to make my website with the 3 Legendary Services: GDucpm Learning, GDucpm's Games, and GDucSoft. But because of the change of the plan, I'm not going to continue making the website. Nevertheless, I will someday release the source of the website.</p>

				<h3>What do you think about <strong>unethical</strong> social media platforms</h3>

					<img src="/img/facebook.webp" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail col-md-6" alt="An image for facebook">
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">An image for facebook</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p><i>Whoa, that's a weird idea.</i></p>
				<p>Facebook is a world-popular social media aimed at all ages, providing an engaging social media experience. However, I must say I oppose it for ethical reasons. Facebook has massive data collection, for example, they've built an ecosystem where millions of websites on the Internet send interaction usage to Facebook (a.k.a. Meta Pixel), and other awkward tracking patterns like deleted posts or liked posts. After all, I see this as unethical. It normally is okay with only a bit of tracking, but this is a completely different story. It made me extremely concerned. They harvest our data and make billions. But I don't care! They're out there hosting a social media just for their greed. As a <a href="#sec1">philosopher</a>, I don't want to do unethical stuff even if I make much.</p>
				<p>If you share the same thought, you can always lend a hand. What if you simply tell people to stop using Facebook? I appreciate any help to stop this evil social media. Thanks for hearing my thoughts about this.</p>
				<p>Fun fact: The term for this is "surveillance capitalism".</p>

					<p>I am currently installing Gentoo Linux, and it is the world's hardest Linux distribution to use. A lot of parts for the (manual) installation is very similar to Arch's hands-on installation, but some parts like the stage3 tarball are completely different. Gotta say, I spent 12 hours for the installation and it is not done. You see, on Gentoo, everything is compiled from source code (code developers can read) to bytecode/binary code (code machines can read) and it is the whole philosophy of Gentoo. However, compiling them (especially in a virtual machine like me) takes an enormous amount of time and needs patience.</p>
